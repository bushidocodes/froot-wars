# Froot Wars

This repository contains the static assets for the Froot Wars game. To play the game locally you need to serve these files through a web server.

## Running the site locally

All modern operating systems provide simple ways to run a basic web server. Use the commands below for your platform and then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Linux

```bash
cd /path/to/froot-wars
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### macOS

```bash
cd /path/to/froot-wars
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Windows

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```cmd
cd path\to\froot-wars
py -m http.server 8000
```

Once the server is running you can access the game at `http://localhost:8000`.
